Data types in C++

char
A character datatype stores a single character
char c = 'A';

int
An integer datatype stores an integer number
int i = 34;

bool
A boolean datatype stores a true or false, true is 1, false is 0
bool isTrue = true;

float
A float stores numbers with decimal points
float f = 46.6;

string
A string is a sequence of letters,
string s = "C++"

function
A function is a segment of code seperate from the main function that performs a specific task
int func(){...}

arr
An array is a collection of other variables
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

Prompt: how to output a string and a int in c++
Response:
"To output a string and an integer in C++ using std::cout, you can simply insert them into the output stream one after the other using the insertion operator (<<), separated by an additional string literal like a space or a new line character for readability [1].
Example
cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string myString = "The number is: ";
    int myInt = 42;

    // Output the string and the integer separated by a space,
    // followed by a newline character
    std::cout << myString << myInt << std::endl;

    // Alternatively, you can use the newline character '\n'
    // for potentially better performance
    std::cout << myString << myInt << '\n';

    return 0;
}
Key Components
#include <iostream>: This header file is necessary to use standard input/output functionalities like std::cout and std::endl.
std::cout: This is the standard output stream object in C++.
<< (Insertion Operator): This operator is used to send data to the std::cout stream. It automatically handles the conversion of different data types (like std::string and int) to their appropriate string representation for output.
std::endl or '\n': These are used to insert a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line of the console.
Output of the Example
When you run the code above, the output will be:
The number is: 42
The number is: 42"
